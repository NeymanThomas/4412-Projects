# 4412 Projects
This repo contains the various projects required for class 4412 - Advanced Algorithms at Idaho State University. The primary language being utilized is [Python](https://www.python.org/). The code implemented is intended purely for educational purposes.

### [Project 1](https://github.com/NeymanThomas/4412-Projects/tree/main/Project-1)
Fermat: The purpose of this project is to get you up and running with Python. You will also gain experience with algorithms for modular arithmetic. In this project, you will implement a prime number test based on Fermat's little theorem and the Miller-Rabin conditions.

### Project 2
Convex Hull: In this project, you will implement a divide and conquer algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points and you will analyze the algorithm both theoretically and empirically.

### Project 3
Network Routing: In this project you will implement Dyskstraâ€™s algorithm to find paths through a graph representing a network routing problem. You will use two different data structures to implement a priority queue in order to see that both algorithm design *and* data structure implementation significantly affect performance.

### Project 4
Gene Sequencing: In this project, you will implement two versions of a dynamic programming algorithm for computing the minimal cost of aligning gene sequences and extracting (an) optimal alignment. In the process, you will learn a little bit about computational genomics and how domain knowledge can affect algorithm design.

### Project 5
Traveling Salesperson: In this project, you will implement a branch and bound algorithm to find solutions to the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) and get your first taste of dealing with NP-completeness.

### Project 6
TSP Group Project: In this project, you will work in a small group to compare accuracy and the theoretical and empirical complexity of different algorithmic "solutions" to the traveling salesmen problem (TSP), including greedy, branch and bound, and an algorithm of your choice. In this context, a "solution" is an approximation that is found in reasonable time.
