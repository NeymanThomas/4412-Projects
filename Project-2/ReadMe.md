The convex hull of a set Q of points is the smallest convex polygon P for which each point in Q is either on the boundary of P or in its interior. 
To be rigorous, a polygon is a piecewise-linear, closed curve in the plane. That is, it is a curve, ending on itself that is formed by a sequence 
of straight-line segments, called the sides of the polygon. A point joining two consecutive sides is called a vertex of the polygon. If the polygon 
is simple , as we shall generally assume, it does not cross itself. The set of points in the plane enclosed by a simple polygon forms the interior of 
the polygon, the set of points on the polygon itself forms its boundary , and the set of points surrounding the polygon forms its exterior . A simple 
polygon is convex if, given any two points on its boundary or in its interior, all points on the line segment drawn between them are contained in the 
polygon's boundary or interior.
