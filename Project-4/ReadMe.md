#Project 4
In this project, you will implement dynamic programming algorithms for computing the minimal cost of aligning gene sequences and for extracting optimal alignments.
</br></br>
You are using dynamic programming to align multiple gene sequences (taxa), two at a time. In light of the SARS outbreak a few years ago, we have chosen to use the SARS 
virus as one of our DNA sequences. SARS is a coronavirus, and we have also provided the genomes for several other coronaviruses. It is your job in this project to align 
all pairs in order to assess the pair-wise similarity. To prepare to succeed on this project, make sure you understand the sequence alignment and solution extraction 
algorithms as presented in class and in the book.

##Usage
**goals:**
1. Design and implement a Dynamic Programming algorithm that has applications to gene sequence alignment.
2. Think carefully about the use of memory in an implementation.
3. Solve a non-trivial computational genomics problem.
